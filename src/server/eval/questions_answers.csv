"I'm home, but I'm still in a good bit of pain. What's the best thing to do for it?","I'm sorry to hear you're uncomfortable. To lessen discomfort, you can first try changing your position; you should do this at least every 45 to 60 minutes. You should also use cold therapy, like an ice pack, on your joint for 20 minutes on, and at least 20 minutes off. (Guide, p. 15)"

"I'm worried about taking these strong opioid pills. Any advice?","Safety is the top priority. If you need to take them, take them only as prescribed and do not take them on an empty stomach. It's very important that you do not drink alcohol while taking opioid pain drugs. (Guide, p. 15)"

"I haven't had a bowel movement in a couple of days. Is this normal?","Yes, it's common for bowel function to return slowly after surgery. For constipation, make sure you are drinking plenty of fluids and use a stool softener or laxative as told by your surgeon. (Guide, p. 13)"
